# JVM Memory Management Project

## Overview
This repository contains the materials and findings from an advanced study on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory management, garbage collection, and optimization techniques. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of JVM internals, different garbage collectors, and best practices for efficient memory management in Java applications.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the JVM architecture and memory model
- Explore different garbage collectors and their characteristics
- Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- Implement and demonstrate memory profiling techniques
